                Yash is an extraordinary individual with extensive knowledge in
                Backoffice. He supported the BD Biosciences website in
                troubleshooting and resolving issues and he was heavily involved
                in key projects and enhancements. Without a doubt, heâ€™s
                dependable and reliable and I would love to work with him again.

                Yash is an asset that you don't want to lose. For a person who
                is young and early into his career, he has shown exceptional
                maturity in handling complex projects, navigating the team, and
                dealing with very tough business folk by demonstrating great
                skills by quickly grasping technical know-how on a SAP Hybris
                Cloud Commerce v2 technology-based project. It's been an amazing
                journey while it lasted, wish it would have lasted longer.
